"""Recover the bridge unattended when the link to the inverter or the network wedges.

This board is a Pi 3B, where ethernet is not native: it hangs off the same single USB
controller as the SP PRO's serial adapter, while the SD card does not. So when that bus
wedges, the inverter link and the network die together and the OS carries on regardless --
systemd timers keep firing, the filesystem stays writable, and nothing recovers on its own.
That is what cost 19 hours on 2026-10-09: everything stopped at 10:21 and the box sat there
healthy-but-useless until it was power cycled by hand.

Rebooting is a blunt fix, so the trigger has to be narrow. "The MQTT push stopped" on its own
is not enough of a reason: the broker is remote, through a tunnel, so an ordinary Home
Assistant restart would look identical to a local fault and we would reboot the solar bridge
every five minutes for as long as HA was down. The two cases are told apart like this:

  bridge unreachable on loopback  -> our USB/serial is gone. Nothing upstream can cause this.
                                     Reset the USB device, then reboot if that fails.
  bridge fine, MQTT stale         -> look at the default gateway. Unreachable means our own
                                     network is gone (the same wedge, other half) and a reboot
                                     is warranted. Reachable means the fault is upstream --
                                     the tunnel, the broker, or HA itself -- so log and wait.

Reboots are rate limited regardless, because a reboot loop is worse than being down: it would
destroy the on-disk block log and make the real cause harder to find.

Before it touches anything, it writes a diagnostic snapshot. This matters more than it looks:
Raspberry Pi OS ships Storage=volatile for the journal to spare the SD card, so every log of
the fault is destroyed by the very reboot we are about to perform -- which is why the 19-hour
outage left nothing to read. The journal does still exist in /run while the box is up, so
capturing it at fault time preserves the part that matters without journald writing to the
card continuously. One gzipped file per fault, newest twenty kept.
